    <h2>The PS2 Era</h2>
    
    <p>
        <i>Ratchet & Clank</i> was first released on the <i>Playstation 2</i> and quickly saw success, becoming one of Sony's main mascots throughout the 2000's, 
        competing with only Sly Cooper, and Jak and Daxter. 
    </p>
    <h3>The Original Trilogy</h3>

        <i>The Original Trilogy</i> is what started it all. It's what brought Ratchet and Clank together, saw them grow into intergalactic heroes, 
        and save the galaxy not once, not twice, but three times. Each adventure became more perilous than the last, as they stopped a planet destroying capitalist 
        overlord in <i>Ratchet & Clank(2002)</i>, saved the Bogon Galaxy from a ruthless genetic experiment gone wrong in <i>Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando</i>, 
        and returned to their home to prevent a robotic evil genius from turning every last citizen into bloodthirsty robots in <i>Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal.</i>

    <h3>Spin-Offs</h3>

    </ul>
    <p>
        Because of the trilogy's massive success, <i>Insomiac Games</i> tried to do something different by modifying the typical platforming experience with a more
        hardcore shooter obstacle course type game. <i>Ratchet: Deadlocked</i> occured after the events of the original trilogy, and followed Ratchet as he was abducted by 
        an illegal game show in which contestants had to survive lethal obstacle courses and fight each other to the death. 
        <br><i>Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters</i> and <i>Secret Agent Clank</i> were outsourced to <i>High Impact Games</i> and developed hand-in-hand for the PSP
        as <i>Insomiac Games</i> prepared to launch their next title for the upcoming <i>Playstation 3</i>. Although these games followed the traditional Ratchet & Clank
        gameplay, many felt that they were too clunky and lacked the typical polish that the original trilogy had. This was partly due to the PSP not having a right 
        analog stick, leading to a clunky camera that was never fixed in the PS2 port.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The PS3 Era</h2>
    <p>
        When Ratchet and Clank were brought onto the PS3, Insomniac Games shifted to a more story-oriented experience. The technology of the PS3 allowed them to
        build a strong narrative around their new adventures.

    <h3>The Future Saga</h3>

</ul>
    <p>
        The <i>Future Saga</i> revealed Ratchet to be the last of his race, left behind by those who were persecuted to the bitter end. They fought and won against
        Emperor Tachyon, who transported him to the Polaris Galaxy in hopes of finding the Lombax Secret. After stopping history from repeating itself, Clank is taken
        by a race known as the Zoni, keepers of time, to fulfill his role as the caretaker of the Universe. Not all is as it seems, as Dr.Nefarious, Ratchet and Clank's
        old rival from <i>Up Your Arsenal</i>, returns to misuse Clank's powers to turn back time and rewrite history so that he wins. 
        <br> Althoug <i>Into the Nexus</i> didn't directly follow the Future Saga's storyline, it served as an epilogue, re-emphasizing the choices that the duo had made
        throughout their journeys and saw them face those consequences. 
        <br><b>Into the Nexus was fully intended to be the conclusion to the Ratchet & Clank universe as a whole until its reboot on the upcoming PS5 
            (as of 09/20)
        </b>

</ul>
    <p>
        Before <i>Into the Nexus,</i> Insomiac Games tried making the franchise into a couch co-op journey. <i>All 4 One</i> was a 4-player action platformer that
        was more linear than most entries and featured puzzles that took 2 or more people to solve. It also saw the duo team up with intergalactic president 
        Captain Qwark and their archnemesis Dr.Nefarious. <i>Full Frontal Assault</i> was a 3rd person tower-defense strategy game in which the player 
        would defend their nodes from oncoming enemies by upgrading defense, turrets, and their own weapons to stop Stuard Zurgo from taking over the Planetary Defence 
        Center.
