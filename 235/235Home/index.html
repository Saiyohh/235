        <p>
            Hi, I'm a second year student at RIT studying Game Design & Development. Ever since I was old enough to hold a Genesis controller,
            I've wanted to be a game developer. There's something inexplicably fantastic about exploring new worlds that I just can't let go of. 
            Some of my favorite games include Spyro, Ratchet & Clank, Apex Legends, Fire Emblem, and Smash Bros. I hope that in the future, I can 
            create games that change other people's lives like these games have changed mine. 
            <br> 
            You can find the navigation bar at the top of this page. You can visit my Github repository to view the code that goes into making
            this website. The project links are non-functioning. I'll update them as time goes on. Thanks for stopping by!
